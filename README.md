# About
This is a modified variant of [DAVx⁵](https://github.com/bitfireAT/davx5-ose), with support to disable discovery for
selected urls by prepending `!` to the URL. This can be useful to provide access to a specific resource only, without
ability to enable other resources without re-entering credentials.
